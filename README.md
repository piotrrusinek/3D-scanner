# 3D-scanner

Project based on ARM Cortex platform FRDM-KL05Z

Main objective was obtaining 3D space visualization using single TOF distance sensor and two stepper motors.

Board moves motors to positions using drivers, then sensor sends measurement to the board with I2C bus which then sends data to PC using UART.
